    "EDA AND CLEANING\n",
    "Data cleaning is a critical step in the data preparation process that involves identifying and addressing issues or inconsistencies in a dataset to improve its quality and reliability. The goal of data cleaning is to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and suitable for analysis or modeling\n",
    "here are some of the key aspects that we looked into on data cleaning \n",
    "\n",
    "Status Filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rows with incomplete or suspended status are removed from the dataset using matches_df = matches_df[matches_df['status'] == 'complete'].\n",
    "\n",
    "Irrelevant Column Removal:\n",
    "Several columns deemed irrelevant for the analysis are dropped from the dataframe using matches_df.drop(columns=irrelevant_columns, inplace=True).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Type Conversion:\n",
    "The -1 values in the dataframe are replaced with 0 using matches_df.replace(-1, 0, inplace=True).\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical Data Encoding:\n",
    "Categorical data types are identified, and appropriate encoding might have been applied to these columns to make them suitable for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Winning Team Recoding:\n",
    "A custom function (winningTeam) is applied to create a new column ('1x2') representing the outcome of each match (1 for home team win, 2 for away team win, and 0 for a draw).\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Date and Timing Data:\n",
    "The date column is of object type, suggesting it may need conversion to a datetime format for proper temporal analysis. Additionally, the homeGoals_timings and awayGoals_timings columns may be processed further to extract meaningful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking Data Types:\n",
    "Data types of various columns are checked to ensure consistency and accuracy. Columns with data types such as 'object', 'bool', and 'int64' are identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Column Renaming:\n",
    "Some column names might need renaming for clarity and consistency. For example, the new column representing the winning team is named '1x2'.\n",
    "\n",
    "These data cleaning steps ensure that the dataset is in a more structured and suitable format for subsequent analysis and model training. Additionally, the recoding of the winning team outcome and handling of categorical variables are crucial steps in preparing the data for machine learning tasks."

    "FEATURE SELECTION\n",
    "\n",
    "we selected 10 features for our modelling us listed below  \n",
    "\n",
    "home_ppg: Average points per game for the home team.\n",
    "away_ppg: Average points per game for the away team.\n",
    "odds_ft_1: Betting odds for the home team winning.\n",
    "odds_ft_x: Betting odds for a draw.\n",
    "odds_ft_2: Betting odds for the away team winning.\n",
    "homeGoalCount: Number of goals scored by the home team.\n",
    "totalGoalCount: Total number of goals scored in the match.\n",
    "team_a_xg_prematch: Expected goals (xG) for team A before the match.\n",
    "team_b_xg_prematch: Expected goals (xG) for team B before the match.\n",
    "total_xg_prematch: Total expected goals (xG) for both teams before the match\n",
    "    \n",
    "This features were seen best to be used for modeling due to some factors and data which they contain all togeether was meaningfull data in the chosen features are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical Performance Metrics (home_ppg and away_ppg):\n",
    "These features provide insights into the historical performance of the home and away teams, indicating their average points per game. Teams with consistently high points per game are likely to perform well in future matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Betting Odds (odds_ft_1, odds_ft_x, and odds_ft_2):\n",
    "Betting odds reflect the market's perception of the likelihood of different outcomes. These odds are crucial in betting projects as they incorporate the wisdom of the crowd and can be indicative of the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal Statistics (homeGoalCount and totalGoalCount):\n",
    "The number of goals scored by the home team and the total number of goals in a match are fundamental indicators of team performance and match dynamics. They offer valuable information for predicting outcomes in betting projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Goals (team_a_xg_prematch, team_b_xg_prematch, and total_xg_prematch):\n",
    "Expected goals (xG) represent the quality of scoring opportunities a team creates or concedes. Including these features allows the model to consider not just the actual goals but also the quality of chances, providing a more nuanced understanding of team strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diversity of Information (a mix of team-specific and match-specific features):\n",
    "The selected features cover a diverse range of information, including team performance, match dynamics, and market sentiment. This diversity can contribute to a more comprehensive and robust model that considers various aspects influencing match outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Random Forest Regressor:\n",
    "The use of RFE with a Random Forest Regressor suggests that the model has iteratively identified these features as the most influential for predicting the target variable. The Random Forest Regressor is capable of capturing complex relationships in the data, and the RFE process ensures that only the most relevant features are retained, reducing overfitting and enhancing generalization to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the selected features encompass a mix of historical performance, betting market insights, goal statistics, and expected goals, providing a well-rounded set of indicators for predicting match outcomes in a betting project. The combination of these features, along with the model selection and feature elimination process, contributes to the effectiveness of the predictive model.\n",
