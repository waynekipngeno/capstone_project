    "## 1. Background\n",
    "The betting industry in Kenya has undergone a transformative shift, evolving into a multi-billion-dollar industry. According to the Betting Control and Licensing Board of Kenya, the sector has grown exponentially, contributing significantly to the nation's economic development. The latest available data from the board indicates that the industry generated over Ksh 204 billion (approximately USD 2 billion) in revenue in the last fiscal year alone ([Betting Control and Licensing Board - Kenya](https://bclb.co.ke/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this burgeoning industry, soccer betting has emerged as the undisputed frontrunner, capturing the imagination of millions of Kenyan sports enthusiasts. A survey conducted by GeoPoll, a mobile-based market research platform, revealed that over 60% of mobile gamers in Kenya actively engage in soccer betting, making it the dominant betting category ([GeoPoll](https://www.geopoll.com/blog/the-rise-of-mobile-gaming-in-africa/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The allure of soccer betting lies in its dynamic and unpredictable nature, where punters navigate through a plethora of betting options. From predicting the winner of a match to anticipating the total goals scored, the process involves a meticulous analysis of team and player statistics, historical performances, and real-time match dynamics. Kenyan sports enthusiasts, fueled by their passion for the game, seek to translate their knowledge into profitable betting decisions ([Daily Nation](https://www.nation.co.ke/kenya/sports/-/1090/1090/-/h96psf/-/index.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing the demand for more informed and accurate betting decisions, the intersection of technology and sports betting has witnessed a surge in predictive modeling. The Kenya Gazette, an official government publication, acknowledges the potential of predictive models in providing valuable insights to bettors, helping them make data-driven decisions to enhance their success rate ([Kenya Gazette](https://www.kenyagazette.co.ke/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This research project focuses on the development of a simplified soccer match outcome prediction system for the English Premier League. The envisioned product is a user-friendly system where a client inputs a match ID, and the system, powered by machine learning, provides a prediction for the match outcome. Leveraging advanced algorithms, the system aims to offer straightforward and reliable match predictions based on historical data and relevant match features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amid the remarkable growth in the Kenyan betting industry, there exists a research gap in the application of machine learning to provide simplified match predictions for soccer enthusiasts. This project aims to address this gap by introducing cutting-edge data science techniques into the realm of Kenyan soccer betting, offering users a practical and accessible tool to enhance their betting experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Problem Statement\n",
    "The surge in popularity of sports betting, particularly in the vibrant betting industry of Kenya, has prompted an increasing demand for accurate and data-driven predictions, especially in the context of soccer matches. Despite the availability of vast amounts of football-related data, there is a notable gap in providing simplified and user-friendly prediction systems for Kenyan soccer enthusiasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "i. **Lack of Accessibility:**\n",
    "   Existing machine learning predictive models often lack accessibility for the average user, requiring a level of expertise in data interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. **Limited Utilization of Advanced Techniques:**\n",
    "    Additionally, current betting prediction platforms may not utilize advanced machine learning techniques to offer precise and tailored predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. **Accuracy Limitations:**\n",
    "     Current predictive models for soccer match outcomes, even with advanced techniques, have encountered challenges in achieving high accuracy. Studies, such as Md. Ashiqur Rahman's research titled \"A deep learning framework for football match prediction,\" have reported a maximum accuracy of approximately 63% using advanced models. Addressing and surpassing this accuracy threshold poses a notable challenge in the development of soccer match prediction systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. **Complexity in Feature Selection:**\n",
    "    The vast array of available features in soccer match data introduces complexity in selecting the most influential factors for accurate predictions. Properly navigating through these numerous features and identifying the key variables that significantly impact match outcomes is a substantial challenge. Effective feature selection will play a crucial role in optimizing the prediction model's performance and enhancing accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Opportunity\n",
    "The opportunity lies in developing a simplified and user-friendly soccer match outcome prediction system for the English Premier League. This system aims to empower users with accurate match predictions, leveraging machine learning algorithms to process historical data and relevant match features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Research Questions\n",

    "\n",
    "iii. How can a simplified prediction system be designed to cater to the needs of Kenyan soccer betting enthusiasts?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Research Questions\n",
    "i. What are the distribution patterns of key performance metrics, such as team ranks, points, and goal differentials, across the English Premier League teams?\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Are there any correlations or trends between a team's historical performance metrics and its current rank in the league standings?\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. How do teams' performance metrics vary when playing at home versus playing away?\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Can patterns or trends be identified in the outcomes of matches based on the results of the last five games' results for each team?\n",
    "\n",
    "v. What role does goal difference play in determining the outcome of matches, and how does it correlate with the teams' overall performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Additional Machine Learning Model Assessment Questions\n",
    "i. How sensitive is the prediction model to changes in input features, and which features contribute most significantly to prediction outcomes?\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. What impact do changes in the training dataset size and composition have on the model's predictive performance?\n",
    "\n",
